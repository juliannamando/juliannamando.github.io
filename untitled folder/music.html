      <h2>IGOR: My Favorite Album</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 28, 2021</h5>
      <img src="igor.jpg" alt="IGOR">
      <p>IGOR is an album, written, produced, and sung by Tyler, The Creator. It tells a full length story of a relationship starting from the beggining of it all the way to the end. This album has impeccable and experimental production, a lot of different sounds and singing styles, and a great story to tie it all together. No doubt this album is timesless and will always be a masterpiece.    </p>

      <h2>Ungodly Hour: A Recent Obsession</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 25, 2021</h5>
      <img src="ungodly.jpg" alt="Ungodly Hour">
      <p>Ungodly Hour, an album by Chloe X Halle is an underrated R&B album. These two sisters have such different tones of voice and styles of singing, but somehow their harmonies and voices generally mesh so well together. All their songs ae unlike the others and that variability is what makes a good album. It's fun, vibrant, has good beats and overall needs more recognition from fans of R&B music. </p>

      <h2>Collide: One of My Favorite Songs</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 23, 2021</h5>
      <img src="collide.jpg" alt="Collide">
      <p>I chose to feature this song because it has never become redundant to me and features two artists with graceful and gorgeous voices. For being a song from The Queen and Slim soundtrack, the lyrics are so beautiful and passionate. It is just very pleasing to the ears and Tiana Major9 and EARTHGANG do what they do to do within their parts to make this song what it is.  </p>

      <h2>Janelle Monet: An Artist Who is Underrated</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 20, 2021</h5>
      <img src="monet.jpg" alt="Janelle">
      <p>One word to decribe Janelle Monet: ICON. This women is a role model to so many women around the world, incuding myself. Being a black, queer singer, who sings about what she feels needs to be said is amazing. She always has important messages within her lyrics or just generally in the things she puts her name on. I think she needs to be more recognized within pop culture and society nowadays than she is right now, and her music is top teir quality.  </p>

      <h2>Sawayama: My Ultimate Pump Up Album</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 17, 2021</h5>
      <img src="rina.jpg" alt="Rina">
      <p> Rina Sawayama is another underrated artist that I think deserves more recognition. This album is so fun and I love to drive around in the car and just dance and scream the lyrics to this album. She even got recognition from THE Elton John when he asked to hop on her song Chosen Family. I think the vibrancy of this album is really cool and wavy. She is still getting started and I can't wait to hear what she has next for us. </p>
