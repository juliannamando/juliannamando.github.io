      <h2>High Fidelity: My Favorite Movie</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 27, 2021</h5>
     <img src="fidelity.jpg" alt="High Fidelity">
      <p>The movie High Fidelity, directed by Stephen Frears, is condsidered to be my favorite movie of all time. In this film Rob, played by John Cusack, is the owner of a failing record store in Chicago, where he sells music the old-fashioned way -- on vinyl. Although they have an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music and are consumed by the music scene, it's of no help to Rob, whose needle skips the love groove when his long-time girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), walks out on him. As he examines his failed attempts at romance and happiness, the process finds him being dragged, kicking and screaming, into adulthood.

      This movie maintains top tier comedy, while having a dark, relatable edge to it. It’s not often we’re given a hero as blinkered as Rob Gordon and not told how we’re supposed to feel about him. Throughout the film, Rob talks directly to the camera, a personal aspect that is lacked within modern cinema, and we get to hear from his own voice how much of a pretencious asshole he believes he is. Through this however, we get honestly and unfaultered realsim, something I always crave within film. To put the cherry on top of a naturally classic movie, this movie was Jack Black's breakout role, something that can't go unsaid. </p>

      <h2>Baby Driver: The Perfection Within Its Directing</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 26th, 2021</h5>
      <img src="driver.jpg" alt="Baby Driver">
      <p>With Direction led by legend Edgar Wright, there's no doubt this movie hold up to his high level of cinematic greatness. After being coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver (Baby)finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail. The one thing that I have always raved about from this movie is the way the sountract perfectly lines up with the actions being shown throughout the movie. This is most prevelant though within the first scene of the movie and the opening credits. Every move lines with the the beats in the song and it is just beautiful to watch. It sets the tone to where the rest of the movie is going to progress and I love it for that. The only downside to this movie is that it is somewhat tainted from the actions of Ansel Elgort and Kevin Spacey, who play the two more prevalent part within the movie. </p>

      <h2>Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle: The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 21, 2021</h5>
      <img src="harold.jpg" alt="Harold & Kumar">
      <p>This one might shock people to be on this list. This movie is my confort movie. I watch it when I'm sad, happy, stressed, it doesn't matter. This movie is about Nerdy accountant Harold and his irrepressible friend, Kumar, get stoned watching television and find themselves utterly bewitched by a commercial for White Castle. Convinced there must be one nearby, the two set out on a late-night odyssey that takes them deep into New Jersey. Reading that, how could not believe you would get a laugh from this movie. While it's not very deep or have an impactful message, it a great movie to watch with your frinds while endulging on some food.  </p>

      <h2>The Marvel Cinematic Universe: My Favorite Movie Franchise</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 16, 2021</h5>
      <img src="marvel.jpg" alt="Marvel">
      <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is the biggest movie franchise in history. With 25 movies and 4 shows within this franchise, you have to be a die hard fan to make it this far. For someone who isn't a huge fan of the sci fi genre, somehow marvel makes it interesting, always bringing something new to the table. I love how each superhero can branch off with their own storylines and fight their own battles, but then can come together to make epic movies. I will always love marvel and the characters/storylines it chooses to develop. If you are willling to go on the marvel movie binge, I say do it because they are fun, thrilling, and great for the whole family. </p>

      <h2>Midsommar: A Movie I Can't Explain Why I Love</h2>
      <h5>By Julianna Mandarino, Oct 10, 2021</h5>
      <img src="midsommar.jpg" alt="Midsommar">
      <p>Midsommar, oh midsommar. Where do I begin with this movie. This movie follows a couple (along with friends) who travel to Sweden to visit their friend's rural hometown for its fabled midsummer festival, but what begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult. It's a shocking, disturbing, gruesome film that somehow manages to maintain beautiful aesthetics to contradict the events taking place. Even though this movie is deranged, I do think it shows a lot of emotions and the character development within the main character Dani is somehow inspiring. I reconmmend watching the movie with someone who has seen it beforehand, because I feel like everyone needs to witness someone's first reaction to this movie. </p>
