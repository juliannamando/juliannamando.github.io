      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="juj.jpg" alt="Julianna Mandarino">
      <p>My name is Julianna Mandarino and ever since I was young, I have been obsessed with entertainment and pop culture. It feels like just yesterday that my sister and I were running around listening to The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stephanie on our bulky MP3 players. I come from a family who loves to watch Tv Shows or Movies as a family, and would even take us out every friday to go see the latest theatrical release. This became a tradition that has shaped me into the "movie critic" I am today. With that introduction, this website it designed to show off my favorite movies, music, and tv shows. Enjoy!</p>
